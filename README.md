#Sortir.io Attestation Generator for COVID-19 Lockdowns

Sortir.io is a quick attestation generator to help you when you need to go out during lockdown in France. You only need to enter your personal details once, and then each time you return you just tap on the reason you're going out and an attestation will be generated immediately. Go to https://sortir.io on your mobile phone, then choose "Add to Home Screen" to save it as an App.

Sortir.io saves your personal data to your browser's local storage, which means that until you clear
your cache, it can keep the form filled in for you.  It also means that none of your data is transmitted
anywhere, so it's entirely safe.
